I don't know where i crossed the line
Was it something that I said
Or didn't say this time
And I don't know if it's me or you
But I can see the skies are changing
In all the shades of blue
And I don't know 
Which way it's gonna go
If it's gonna be a rainy day 
There is nothing we can do to make it changed
